This file will answer the following question:
What are these scripts and for what they are used?


- the scripts were made to be used after installing a new linux
I found a hassle having to type all the same commands and configure
it by hand everytime I shifted my environment

So these scripts are intended to automatize this work
Feel free to make modifications for your own use
or use it as it is.
